# 🦸‍♀️ Local Hero Finder

**Local Hero Finder** is a community-driven emergency assistance platform built to connect people in urgent need with nearby trained responders, such as those certified in CPR, first aid, or basic emergency care.  




It’s designed as a proof-of-concept MVP to demonstrate real-time geolocation, role-based user authentication, and responder availability management using **Supabase**, **React**.
Didn't have enought time to implement all features or debug everything:
- supbase RLS policy issues
- certain browsers restricing location(work around is just putting in address)
